A set of helper scripts for Git/SVN bridge

git_gc.sh - runs 'git gc' for Git repository, and runs 'git svn gc' if the repository is connected to SVN

git_svn_up.sh - runs an equivalent of 'svn update' on Git repository connected to SVN, i.e.
 'git svn merge' and 'git svn dcommit'. The script checks for uncommited content before running the commands

svn-to-git.sh - migrates given SVN repository to GIT. Requires users.txt file in current directory.
