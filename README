A set of helper scripts for Git/SVN bridge

git_gc.sh - runs 'git gc' for Git repository, and runs 'git svn gc' if the repository is connected to SVN

git_svn_up.sh - runs an equivalent of 'svn update' on Git repository connected to SVN, i.e.
 'git svn merge' and 'git svn dcommit'. The script checks for uncommited content before running the commands
